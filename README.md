# Open Datasets

I generally tend to work with Indian government datasets. They are spread over http://data.gov.in and many other government websites. Often, the ones at the [data portal](http://data.gov.in) are aggregated values and not granular enough or are only at district level without state level aggregation.

The objective of this repository is to share collated or augmented public datasets, not necessarily restricted to government data.
