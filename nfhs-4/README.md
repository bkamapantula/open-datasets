# NFHS4

National Family Health Survey 4 was carried out during the years 2015 and 2016 across different states.

## Data

[Data portal](http://data.gov.in) contains records at individual state level without a cummulative view at national level.

Apart from State and District details, details for over 90 parameters (population profile, socio-economic factors, female fertility, different disease markers etc.) are provided.

## Curation

During the Hyderabad #OpenGovDataHack on Nov 4-5, a group of us (Tejesh, Bhasker, Sarat) merged and cleaned the data which we are making available here.

## Gotchas

Many entries for % columns have negative values. Perhaps you could assume the absolute values for your analysis. Otherwise the value itself makes no sense.
